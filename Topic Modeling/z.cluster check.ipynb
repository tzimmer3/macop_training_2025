He clearly describes that oil and gas is still a pertinent part of what we do as a company and that there should be a more balanced approach/discussion on the policies of this current administration. I 100% agree with his stance! What I’m worried about though as an employee is that some not all individuals in our organization have lost the enthusiasm behind the bread and butter of our company, oil and gas. Some days, I feel like I can’t even have a straight conversation with individuals in my immediate team because I might offend someone. I feel that we as a company must be clear about our priorities for the future and if people want to be just focused on green, good for them, but maybe Chevron isn’t the place for you. We can do all these things, why does it have to be all or nothing in some people’s minds? It’s very hard to navigate this topic with certain individuals we work alongside daily and to me, it’s a no brainer. Either you support the company you work for, or you don’t and it’s time to move on.

This behavior, driven by the desire to be a team player and avoid obstacles, is setting us up for failure in meeting our project deliverables. The consequences are evident in the unsuccessful outcomes of various projects across the corporation (GOM, Kazakhstan, MCBU, etc..). Additionally, it's troubling that more experienced employees who raise concerns are swiftly sidelined or excluded from the decision-making process, exacerbating the issue. This behavior poses a serious threat to our safety culture and could lead to catastrophic failures in the long run. Addressing this issue is crucial, considering that the current processes in place are failing to deliver the necessary results. I propose establishing a team of experienced subject matter experts (SMEs) within Chevron. Their role would involve rigorously testing assumptions on every project without fear of reprisals. These empowered SMEs can inject a dose of reality into our wishful thinking, ultimately preventing the costly consequences we are currently facing. What are your thoughts on implementing such a proactive approach?</td>\n",
